# Image Processing API

## How to use the API

- This API does not have any interface. It does not display the images in the browser.
- Start the server by running "npm run start". Build it with "npx tsc". Test it with npm run test
- Navigate to /api by typing it into the URL
- Write your instructions for the image processing in the URL based on the provided syntax (without *: api/convert?filename=*filename*&width=*number*&height=*number\*)
- Available image files are the ones provided by udacity. (encenadaport, fjord, icelandwaterfall, palmtunnel, santamonica)
- Run the API and check the thumb folder which includes the generated image

## Additional information

- Regarding prettier: The VSCode Extention was used for this project.

# Given Instructions

This project aims to give you a real-world scenario in which you would read and write to your disk via a Node.js express server rather than a database. The project you create serves two purposes: to prepare you for setting up scalable code and architecture for real-world projects and tie together some of the most popular middleware and utilities found in Node.js projects. This project barely touches the surface of what is possible but will prove your ability to use what you’ve learned in real-world scenarios.

For this project, refactor and test as much as possible while you are building. Since you are using TypeScript and an unfamiliar library, it is sometimes easier to write and build in plain JS to see what your functions return; remember your submission needs to be in TypeScript. As your skills improve, typing in TypeScript will feel more intuitive. Make sure to remove any debugging code from your final submission.

## Getting Started

Usually, you would get some starter code to build from, but with this project, it’s your job to prove you can do it from scratch, so all that is being provided for you is a folder of license-free stock images you are welcome to use. If you would like to use your own images for this project, you are welcome to do so, but whoever reviews your project will see your images, and when you display your project online, viewers will also see them.

You can use your own images or use the ones provided in this repo: [images](images)
